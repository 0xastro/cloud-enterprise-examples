## Create an instance of LogDNA on IBM Cloud

In this section, we will review the steps you must take when creating a LogDNA instance.  
The steps we will take are:
- Create the LogDNA instance
- instructions on how to configure it to collect from platform services
- finally the dashboard which helps you review the logs from all the sources.  

For creating the logDNA in the IBM Client UI, please click [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/ibm-log-analysis-with-logdna) .

Select the plan you are interested in (we have seleced `7 day Log Search` plan). Enter a service name, and click `Create`.
