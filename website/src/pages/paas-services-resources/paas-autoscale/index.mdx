In this section, we cover the auto scale configuration for IBM Event streams, Mongo DB, PostgreSQL, DB2 and Cloud Object Storage.

## IBM Event Streams for IBM Cloud Enterprise

Event Streams uses quotas to control the resources, such as network bandwidth, that a service can consume. The types and levels of quotas depend on whether you're using the Lite, Standard, or Enterprise plan. Please refer link for more details -
https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/EventStreams?topic=eventstreams-kafka_quotas#limits_enterprise.

## Autoscaling for MongoDB  

Autoscaling is designed to respond to the short-to-medium term trends in resource usage on your IBM® Cloud Databases for MongoDB deployment. Please refer link for more details - https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/databases-for-mongodb?topic=databases-for-mongodb-autoscaling.

## Autoscaling for PostgreSql 

Autoscaling is designed to respond to the short-to-medium term trends in resource usage on your IBM® Cloud Databases for PostgreSQL deployment. Please refer link for more details - https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/databases-for-postgresql?topic=databases-for-postgresql-autoscaling.

## Autoscaling for DB2Flexible scaling

Independent scaling of RAM, storage, and compute cores. Please refer link for more details - https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Db2onCloud?topic=Db2onCloud-scale.

## IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS)

IBM Cloud Object Storage is designed to support exponential data growth and cloud-native workloads.  With  built-in  high-speed  file  transfer  capabilities,  cross-region  offerings,  and integrated  services,  IBM  Cloud  Object  Storage  can  help  you  securely  leverage  your  data. More details can be found at:
https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-about-cloud-object-storage.

COS  is  configured  on  a  shared  device  with  a  much  larger  capacity  than  any  individual customer  could  consume.  It  does  not  follow  scale-up  and  scale-down  on  demand.  On  the backend IBM monitors the usage trends and buy additional capacity ahead of demand. So for a customer, it is limitless storage. Please refer link for more details -
