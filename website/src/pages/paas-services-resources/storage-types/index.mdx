In this section, we cover the range of PaaS storage types with different availability, IO bandwidth and IOPS capabilities.

## IBM Cloud Block Storage

Block storage, sometimes referred to as block-level storage, is a technology that is used to store data files on Storage Area Networks (SANs) or cloud-based storage environments. Please refer link for more details - https://www.ibm.com/cloud/block-storage?cm_sp=Cloud-Product-_-OnPageNavLink-IBMCloudPlatform_IBMBlockStorage-_-Storage_ProductBand.

To   know   about   its   core   features   and   available   sizes   with   min-max   IOPS,   refer   to - https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/infrastructure/BlockStorage?topic=BlockStorage-About.

How to configure, manage block storage on IBM Cloud and to understand more about default limits of block storage volumes, refer link - https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/infrastructure/BlockStorage?topic=BlockStorage-block-storage-faqs.

In the IBM Cloud console, you can create a Block Storage for VPC volume when you create a virtual server instance, or create a stand-alone volume to later attach to an instance. Please refer link for more details - https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-block-storage.

## IBM Cloud File Storage

IBM Cloud™ File Storage is persistent, fast, and flexible network-attached, NFS-based File Storage. In this network-attached storage (NAS) environment, you have total control over your file shares function and performance. Please refer link for more details - https://www.ibm.com/cloud/file-storage?cm_sp=Cloud-Product-_-OnPageNavLink-IBMCloudPlatform_IBMFileStorage-_-Storage_ProductBand.

To know about its core features and available sizes with min-max IOPS, refer to - https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/infrastructure/FileStorage?topic=FileStorage-about.

Refer  the  link to understand more about limits of your storage and how to increase it - https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/FileStorage?topic=FileStorage-managinglimits.

## IBM Cloud Object Storage 

IBM Cloud® Object Storage makes it possible to store practically limitless amounts of data, simply and cost effectively. It is commonly used for data archiving and backup; for web and mobile applications; and as scalable, persistent storage for analytics.
