Quick Introduction to Forensic Investigations

</PageDescription>


The science application of digital forensics is used to identity, collect, examine, and analyze the data while preserving the information integrity and maintaining a strict chain of custody of the data, during an investigation and post incident analysis. 

Cloud forensic investigations is considered an emerging field of dital forensics, which involves post-incidence examinations of systems that have distributed processing, multi-tenancy, virtualization and scaling of computations, which present more challenges in identifying the preservation of digital evidence.

There are several critical steps performed when conducting a computer forensic investigation & analysis:<li>Creating mature policy and procedures</li><li>Evidence assessment</li><li>The acquisition of evidence</li><li>Evidence examination</li><li>Producing documentation & reporting</li> 

An investigative approach and analysis of a cloud environment requires more complexity to take into consideration versus traditional computer forensic analysis. One important question to think about when conducting a cloud forensic investigation, where is forensic evidence most commonly found in a cloud environment?

There are additional considerations that should be thought out prior to conducting a forensic investigations in the cloud: <li>Know exactly where your data resides</li><li>How much direct access is there to the infrastructure supporting it</li><li>What cloud type of deployment is being used (PaaS, IaaS, SaaS, XaaS)</li><li>How far down the cloud stack is allowed from the cloud service provider (CSP)</li> <li>What's covered in the service level agreement (SLA)</li><li>What level of forensic information is the CSP bound to make available (see SLA)</li>

###### Note

The physical location of the data could affect the organization from a legal standpoint. Often times, laws and regulations greatly differ depending on what state or country the data is stored.
