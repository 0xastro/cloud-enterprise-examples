Use IBM Cloud Activity Tracker to monitor and track how users and applications interact, while recording user-initiated activities that change the state of a service in IBM Cloud. 
You can use this service to investigate abnormal activity and critical actions and to comply with regulatory audit requirements. In addition, you can be alerted about actions as they happen. The events that are collected comply with the Cloud Auditing Data Federation (CADF) standard.
