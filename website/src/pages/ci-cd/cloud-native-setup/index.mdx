Prepare to run a Private Catalog Tile or IBM Schematics to install the CNCF Cloud-Native DevOps Tools into an existing IBM Cloud managed OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster

Prerequisites

</PageDescription>

The CNCF Cloud-Native DevOps Tools are installed by an IBM Cloud Account administrator, who will run the IasC to create the environment in an IBM Cloud account. The scripts will run as the environment administrator's user. These instructions explain how to configure and run the Terraform (IasC) scripts to create the <Globals name="env" />.

<InlineNotification>

**Note**: The Terraform scripts will clean up the cluster to remove any existing installation that may have been previously been installed.

</InlineNotification>

### Confirm permissions

Optional: To help confirm that the scripts will have the permissions they'll require, the environment administrator may log into the account and test creating a couple of resources:
- [Create a cluster](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/catalog/cluster/create) -- Make it single-zone, and specify the proper data center and resource group
- Create a namespace in the image registry

As long as the user can create these resources successfully the schematics terraform script will be able to apply its state to the cluster.

Configure IBM Cloud Private Catalog Tile or IBM Schematics workspace to install a collection of CNCF Cloud-Native Tools to support CI/CD DevOps

</PageDescription>

### Install with Private Catalog Tile

<p></p>

- First step is to create a Catalog, Click **Manage->Catalogs**
- Click on **Create Catalog** , provide a name for example `Team Catalog`
- Click **Update** to change the default resource group for the Catalog
- Click **Create** to complete the Catalog Creation

- Next step is to run the following script to register Cloud-Native Toolkit
 tile into the Catalog as an offering. You will need an IBM Cloud API Key

- Clone this repository to the Cloud Shell or you local workstation
- Run the `offering.sh` scripts passing in the API Key and the name of the
 Catalog that you created
- If you are not running this from the [Cloud Shell](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloud-shell) you will need to install `jq` into you command line environment [jq downloads](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/)

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/cloudnative-toolkit
    cd cloudnative-toolkit
    ./offering.sh {API_KEY} "Team Catalog"
    ```

### Install with IBM Schematics

<p></p>

- This link [Cloud Native Toolkit](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/cloudnative-toolkit)
will give you more information about the Terraform that is used to install the tools.

- Create a workspace in IBM Schematics service and call it `cloud-native-toolkit` and place it in your nominate resource group.

- On the Settings view import your terraform template
    ```bash
    https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/cloudnative-toolkit
    ```
- select `terraform_v0.12` version from the Terraform version drop down
- click **Save template information**

</Tab>

<Tab label="Variables">

<PageDescription>

To support the running of the Terraform for the CNCF DevSecOps installation configure your variables

</PageDescription>

The installation requires a set of variables to be set for your environment.  The Private Catalog Tile or IBM Schematics Terraform assumes that a cluster has already been created and CNCF tools will be installed into an existing cluster.

| **Variable**   | **Description**  | **eg. Value**  |
|---|---|---|
| `ibmcloud_api_key` | The API key from IBM Cloud Console that support service creation access writes  | `{guid API key from Console}`  |
|  `resource_group_name` | The name of the resource group where the cluster is created  | `dev-team-one`  |
|  `cluster_type`       |  The name of the cluster |  `kubernetes or ocp4` |
|  `cluster_name`       |  The name of the cluster |  `dev-team-one-iks-117-vp` |
|  `cluster_exists`     |  Does the cluster exist already | `true`  |
|  `vpc_cluster`        | Is the cluster created in a VPC  | `true`  |

### Environment variables

Set them based on the existing cluster:
- `resource_group_name` -- The existing cluster's resource group
- `cluster_exists` -- Set to `true` for an existing cluster
- `cluster_type` -- Specify the existing cluster's type
    - **kubernetes** -- Kubernetes
    - **ocp3** -- OpenShift v3
    - **ocp4** -- OpenShift v4
- `cluster_name` -- The existing cluster's name
- `vpc_cluster` -- Is the cluster running in a VPC

<p/>

<InlineNotification>

**Note**: The values for `resource_group_name` and `cluster_name` can be found on the Resource List page in the [IBM Cloud Console](https://cloud.ibm.com/resources)
  for the cluster

Install from the Private Catalog Tile or Apply the Schematics workspace to complete configuration

</PageDescription>

### Private Catalog Tile

<p></p>

- Accept the **Apache 2** License

- Click **Install**

- This will kick off the installation of the CNCF Cloud-Native DevOps Tools into a development cluster

- Navigate to the **Schematics** service and track the logs for the configuration

- Once complete you can now start to use the development tools in your cloud native project



### Schematics

<p></p>

- Having configured the variables for the workspace you can now apply it

- Navigate to the Workspace you have configured `cloud-native-toolkit`
- Click on the **Apply**

    Installing the tools into an existing cluster takes about 30 minutes. You can view the workspace logs to see the progress of the execution of the Schematics Terraform scripts

- Once the tools are installed with Terraform using IBM Cloud Schematics you will see this message in the logs
    ```
     2020/06/01 10:55:46 Terraform apply |
     2020/06/01 10:55:46 Terraform apply | Apply complete! Resources: 59 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

     2020/06/01 10:55:51 Command finished successfully.
     ```

- End of the installation process

    <InlineNotification kind="success">

    You have now successfully provisioned and configured the CNCF DevOps Tools. Enjoy!

    </InlineNotification>

### <Globals name="env" />

Once the Schematics scripts have finished, you can see the resources that the scripts created in IBM Cloud:
- In the IBM Cloud console, open the [Resource List](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-ui#dashboardview "Managing resources in the resource list")
- On the Resource List page, filter by your Resource Group (e.g. `dev-team-one`)
- You should see these resources listed:
    - **Clusters**: 1, either Kubernetes or OpenShift
- Select the cluster and open the Kubernetes dashboard or OpenShift web console. You should see:
    - Namespaces: `tools`, `dev`, `test`, and `staging`
    - Deployments in the `tools` namespace: `developer-dashboard`, `jenkins`, etc.


- To get started open the Developer Dashboard or navigate to the tools using the OpenShift Tools menu.

- For more information on how to get start walk through these guides
    - [Configure the client Development Tools](cloud-native-setup-tools)
    - [Deploy your Application](cloud-native-deploy)

### Possible issues

If you find that that the Terraform provisioning has failed, try deleting the workshpace and configuring it again
