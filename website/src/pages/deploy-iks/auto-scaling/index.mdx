In this section we will understand about automatic scaling in Kubernetes. It comes in two forms:

  - **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** scales the pods in a deployment or replica set. It is autoscaling at pod level. It is implemented as a Kubernetes API resource and a controller. The controller manager queries the resource utilization against the metrics specified in each HorizontalPodAutoscaler definition. 

  - **Cluster Autoscaler (CA)** is the Kubernetes component that can be used to perform scaling nodes in a cluster. It periodically scans the cluster to adjust the number of worker nodes within the worker pools for pending pods to scales-up and to scale down underutilized worker nodes. To understand more about scale-up and scale-down and how it works, you can read [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-ca).
