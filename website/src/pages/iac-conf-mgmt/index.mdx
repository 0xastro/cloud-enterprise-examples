Introduction to different Configuration Management Tools

</PageDescription>

The following Configuration Management Tools are introduced in this section.

1. [User Data](/iac-conf-mgmt/user-data) with Cloud-Init and Shell Scripts
2. [Ansible](/iac-conf-mgmt/ansible)
3. [Helm](/iac-conf-mgmt/helm)

Make sure to follow the instructions in the [Setup Environment](/iac/setup-environment) section to properly configure your access to IBM Cloud.

During this section we'll use the code from the [IaC Pattern Guide repository](https://github.com/IBM/cloud-enterprise-examples/) where there is a directory per topic covered in this section.
