### Introduction
In this article, we will provide you resources or cloud patterns that gets you started with the different capabilities on IBM Cloud. 
For any organization to move their applications to the cloud, certain capabilities that are required are:
- Automated provisioning of resources (Infrastructure as code)
- Logging
- Monitoring
- Autoscaling of applications
- CI/CD
- Security

### 1. Automated provisioning of resources (Infrastructure as code)

### 4. CI/CD
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
### 5. Autoscaling

#### 5.1 IBM Kubernetes Service

We can build highly available and scalable applications on IBM Cloud Kubernetes service. In this section, we provide you links to resources that help you set up a IKS cluster on a Virtual Private Cloud, and see the autoscaling in action.
