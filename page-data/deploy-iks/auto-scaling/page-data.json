It comes in two forms:\n\n  - **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** scales the pods in a deployment or replica set. It is autoscaling at pod level. It is implemented as a Kubernetes API resource and a controller. The controller manager queries the resource utilization against the metrics specified in each HorizontalPodAutoscaler definition. \n\n  - **Cluster Autoscaler (CA)** is the Kubernetes component that can be used to perform scaling nodes in a cluster. It periodically scans the cluster to adjust the number of worker nodes within the worker pools for pending pods to scales-up and to scale down underutilized worker nodes. To understand more about scale-up and scale-down and how it works, you can read [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-ca).\n\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"4edcd110aba8be09ca5fb1c86ebd4b0b","counter":751,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Auto-Scaling of Kubernetes Cluster","description":"Overview","keywords":"ibm cloud iks scaling autoscaling"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Auto-Scaling of Kubernetes Cluster\ndescription: Overview\nkeywords: 'ibm cloud iks scaling autoscaling'\n---\n\nIn this section we will understand about automatic scaling in Kubernetes.
